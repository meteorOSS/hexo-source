## Hexo-Source: Test Repository
This is a testing ground for an automated process that converts GitHub Issues into blog posts.

How It Works
Issues created in this repository will be automatically synchronized and published as blog posts on https://meteoross.github.io/.
This serves as a live demonstration of integrating GitHub Issues with Hexo blogging.
Interested?
If you're interested in this workflow and want to implement it for your own blog, check out the main project repository at https://github.com/meteorOSS/hexo-issue-blog-automation for more details and setup instructions.

Feel free to test the process by creating Issues here and seeing them transform into blog posts!
